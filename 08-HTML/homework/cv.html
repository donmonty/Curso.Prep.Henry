      <p class="regular__description">
        I am a creative problem solver with a multidisciplinary background. I graduated with an industrial engineer degree, but have worked as digital marketer, entrepreneur, advertising creative, product designer and product manager.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        Since childhood I dreamed of working at my own company, so I have devoted much of my career to entrepreneurship. I have launched several companies. Some have been successful and others not so much. All of them have been technology related, except for one that had logistics at its core.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        Despite being an entrepreneur at heart, I have also worked for other companies, including two of Mexico’s top advertising agencies, where I helped brands leverage technology to create meaningful experiences for their users. I have also worked as an independent consultant, working with clients on product design, strategy and marketing.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        I’m currently working on Nubebar, a software application that helps bars and restaurants manage their wine and spirits inventory.

          <p class="job__description">
            NubeBar is a SaaS product that helps bars and restaurants manage their spirits inventory with ease and maximum precision in order to avoid theft and increase revenue. For many bars and restaurants, alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.
          <p class="job__description">
            As a solo founder I have taken care of virtually everything, including customer development, UI design, backend engineering and sales.

        I enjoy playing with my guitars and writing songs and music. I'm very interested in cinema and love watching and analyzing movies, especially horror films. I'm also an avid reader and like to read sci-fi novels the most. I have also been a videogame geek since childhood, and although I don't play nearly asu much as before, I enjoy shooting aliens and competing against other people in FPS like Destiny 2. Finally, excercise is a very important part of my life. It helps me clear my mind and to stay fit and full of energy. I have been running regularly for the past 10 years. But since the beginning of the pandemic, I have made a habit of running 10 kms every day.

      <p class="regular__description">
        I believe coding is a new kind of literacy, and possibly the best path to achieve financial freedom in the forseeable future. Having worked at a few tech companies in the past, I have witnessed this trend first-hand. The pandemic and remote work will only accelerate the process.

      <p class="regular__description">
        As more people realize this, the race to become a software developer will intensify. All the information you need to become a software engineer is available for free, but people who enroll in programs whose primary incentive is to make sure you get a good job ASAP will have a huge advantage.

      <p class="regular__description">
        Almost two years ago, I started working on a Saas product for bartenders. I recruited a friend to help me code it, but I needed to figure out how to build the backend because he couldn't put in enough hours. Although I had basic coding skills, this challenge was on another level. But I had to do it, because I already had sold the first subscription. After lots of trial and error and sleepless nights, I got the job done using Django. The product was put together with duct tape, but it worked and I started closing my first sales. The future looked promising. But then the pandemic hit and sales went to zero as bars and restaurants shut down. Game over.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        Even though the vaccines are coming, we are still many months away from going back to "normal". The economic crisis has been brutal in Mexico. My savings are gone and I can't afford the luxury of being an entrepreneur at this moment. I probably could go back to work in advertising, but salaries are low and its future looks bleak. Sure, I have basic coding skills, they are not enough to even get a junior-level job anywhere. To make things harder, I need to help support my parents, as they are retired now but the new government has stopped paying their pensions.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        I believe that, with the right amount of motivation and grit, you can learn anything and become good enough at it in a surprisingly short period of time. I have experienced this several times in my life, learning how to do marketing, sales, UI design, brand communications and Python from scratch. Learning to code is no exception.
      </p>
      <p class="regular__description">
        I believe the Henry program can supercharge my learning process and help me jumpstart an exciting career as a software developer. I'm aware Henry's approach is modeled after Lambda School, an incredible organization that has helped many people like myself with outstanding results. I am sure the combination of Henry's results-driven model and my determination can become a true launchpad for my career.
